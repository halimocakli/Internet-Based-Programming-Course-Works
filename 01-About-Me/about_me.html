            After my compulsory summer internship, I started to work as a Junior Software Engineer at Saykal Elektronik company within the scope of "Candidate Engineering". I continued to develop applications under the WPF framework using C# and XAML languages. I also created a data parsing application using Python language and a radar interface using the PyQT framework. I had the opportunity to work on a user interface where I integrated CANFD and LIN protocols. I also designed a motor driver interface and completed the back-end development. The applications I developed and contributed to the development are as follows:
            "Seat Belt Endurance Test", "Canbus Data Analyser", "Accelerometer Data Parser with Python", "Radar GUI with PyQT5", "Gateway UI", "Contacts App"

            During my compulsory summer internship, I learned OOP principles and desktop programming techniques. I improved my knowledge of C#, XAML and was introduced to the WPF graphical framework, so I had the opportunity to enhance my frontend skills along with the backend. In addition, I learned about serial communication, created a basic serial communication application with WPF, and developed a simple gateway frontend to learn XAML.
